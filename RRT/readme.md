This is a RRT algorithm program, run in the MATLAB environment.       
Add directory to MATLAB path. Run the entire program on the RRT_gui.fig interface.      

After you hit the run, select different types of maps and other restrictions on the pop-up interface, and set their starting points, targets, and obstacles.
